This project contains a simplified eâ€‘commerce template.

### Local setup

1. Upload the repository to a PHP capable web server.
2. Ensure the `data` directory is writable so caching works.
3. If the remote Shoppi API is unreachable the application falls back to the
   sample data located in `data/local_data.json` and the product lists under the
   `data` directory.

The original project required a Shoppi account. For demonstration purposes this
repository now includes example JSON files so the pages can render without an
external account.
