# Foxic Theme Shoppi Website

This project provides a PHP front‑end that connects to the Shoppi API in order to build a multi‑language e‑commerce website.

## Prerequisites

* PHP 7.4 or later
* [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) (for vendor libraries)
* Memcached running locally on port `11211`
* MySQL database (used by cart/checkout plugins)
* A Shoppi account with an active store

## Installation

1. Clone the repository and run `composer install` to fetch PHP dependencies.
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set required variables:
   - `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` – your Stripe restricted API key
   - `APP_LANG` – default language (e.g. `en`)
   - `DB_HOST`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASS`, `DB_NAME` – MySQL connection information
   - `MEMCACHED_HOST`, `MEMCACHED_PORT` – Memcached server (optional)
   - `REDIS_HOST`, `REDIS_PORT` – Redis server (optional)
3. Configure your web server to serve the project root and enable URL rewriting as provided in `.htaccess`.
4. Ensure Memcached, Redis and MySQL are running and accessible if configured.
5. Point the domain configured in Shoppi to this installation.

## Usage

The application will automatically load language strings based on the `lang` query parameter or the value stored in the session. Checkout is handled through the Stripe API using the key configured in the environment file.
